# Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:

# a) Indentify broadcast address:

ifconfig en0 | awk '/broadcast/{print $6}'

# b) Indentify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet:

ifconfig en0 | awk '/broadcast/{print $6}' | xargs ping -c3 | awk '/bytes from/{print $4}' | awk -F'[:]' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

# ping broadcast address to get all addresses of our subnet
